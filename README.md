# BOL4 website revamp

# Idea
The homepage now serves as a vibrant hub for the latest concert news from various locations, featuring events where fans can meet and greet their favorite artists. Additionally, we showcase newly released music videos and albums prominently, ensuring they capture immediate attention.

To foster a deeper connection with the artist, the profile section, providing personal details such as the singer's name, date of birth, and height. This section is designed to make fans feel closer to the artist by offering insights into their background.

In the Discography section, users can explore the different albums the artist has released, allowing them to discover and enjoy music tailored to their preferences. Hover pop-outs have been incorporated to enhance the user experience. Specifically, when hovering over the "Profile" page, the title becomes italicized and bold, providing a visual cue to users. Similarly, hovering over albums in the "Discography" section triggers pop-outs for an interactive exploration.

The Schedule section is dedicated to providing real-time updates on tours and ongoing events, empowering fans to stay informed about concert dates and venues. This feature is aimed at expanding the audience and ensuring more fans can attend these exciting events.

Finally, at the bottom of each page, included links to the artist's various social media accounts. This serves as a gateway for fans to delve into the artist's lifestyle, itinerary, and stay informed about upcoming concerts or song releases. To enhance user interaction, links change color when explored, offering a subtle visual indicator.

## Design Process
 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
