# BOL4 website revamp

## Design Process
The homepage now serves as a vibrant hub for the latest concert news from various locations, featuring events where fans can meet and greet their favorite artists. Additionally, we showcase newly released music videos and albums prominently, ensuring they capture immediate attention.

To foster a deeper connection with the artist, the profile section, providing personal details such as the singer's name, date of birth, and height. This section is designed to make fans feel closer to the artist by offering insights into their background.

In the Discography section, users can explore the different albums the artist has released, allowing them to discover and enjoy music tailored to their preferences. Hover pop-outs have been incorporated to enhance the user experience. Specifically, when in the "Profile" page, the title becomes italicized and bold, providing a visual cue to users. Similarly, hovering over albums in the "Discography" section becomes opaque for an interactive exploration.

The Schedule section is dedicated to providing real-time updates on tours and ongoing events, empowering fans to stay informed about concert dates and venues. This feature is aimed at expanding the audience and ensuring more fans can attend these exciting events.

Finally, at the bottom of each page, included links to the artist's various social media accounts. This serves as a gateway for fans to delve into the artist's lifestyle, itinerary, and stay informed about upcoming concerts or song releases. To enhance user interaction, links change color when explored, offering a subtle visual indicator.

This website is made for those who are interested in knowing more about BOL4, such as the music that's published and about her. Also, to promote BOL4's released albums and keeping track of any events that will happen. My project included about BOL4 for users who want to know more about her and the discography to showcase her released albums.

## Features
Firstly the title, it links to the different pages back and fourth. When in moving to different pages, the title becomes italicized and bold For example, when in the "Profile" page, the title becomes italicized and bold, providing a visual cue to users. Similarly, hovering over albums in the "Discography" section becomes opaque for an interactive exploration. This is also implemented for the music videos.

The "Schedule" page has a special feature which has a countdown that calculates the number of days to the next event.
